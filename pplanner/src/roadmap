keep in mind:
FIX: freeze(printer mutex deadlock?) doesnt show up anymore?

short:
refactor out some dupkicate code in the commands(slice ect)
better help files with examples
remove clones
habits
More signicant classes: months, years
More datetime shorthands like now: idk, dead
Cmd: repeat last command
edit point: replace some fields of many items by that of one
command history, arrows to select

long:
timeslots and sequential planner
scriptableness
auto scheduling(AI)
repeatable events
